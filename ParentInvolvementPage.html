<p> 1) Areas with weak or very weak parent involvement have higher rates of misconduct</p>
<p> 2) The South and Southwest side have the highest proportion of weak parent involvement. These areas also have the highest rates of poverty, suggesting that higher rates poverty cause lower parent involvement</p>
</section>
<p> 3) Very Strong parent involvement appears in wealthier or more resourced northern neighborhoods,(near Evanston or the North Side of Chicago). These areas also show smaller dots, meaning fewer misconduct incidents. This suggests that higher parent involvement reduces misconduct in schools </p>
