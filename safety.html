      <p> Safety in any big city varies depending on the neightborhood, and Chicago is no exception.  These visualizations look into how safety in the different areas of Chicago might affect school performance and graduation rates.  </p>

            <li>1) Northwest Side and the West Side have no schools with very weak safety ratings and a combined total of five schools with weak safety ratings.</li>
            <li>2) The safety rating with the highest frequency in the South Side and Southwest Side is a weak safety rating.</li>
            <li>3) The region with the highest frequency of schools with strong safety ratings is the Far North Side.</li>

         <ul>
            <li>1) The rate of fire arm related crime seems to be the highest in central Chicago and the South Side of Chicago.</li>
            <li>2) As you travel North towards Evanston, the rate of fire arm related crime decreases (the bubbles become smaller), and the percent below poverty rate also decreases (the color of the bubbles is closer to the light blue at the bottom of the scale).</li>
            <li>3) The neighborhoods with the highest rates of firearm related crime usually also have high percentages of people living below the poverty line.</li>
            <li>4) This graph adds interesting insight to the main topic of this page because it shows that the regions with schools with low safety regions like the South Side, Southwest Side, and Central area, also have a larger percent of their population living below the poverty line than the areas with safer schools.</li>

         <ul>
            <li>1) The regions that had a larger number of schools with average or above safety ratings (Far North and Northwest Sides) had the two highest median rates of students passing algebra.  </li>
            <li>2) There seems to be no correlation between having a higher rate of students taking algebra and a higher rate of students passing algebra.  </li>
            <li>3) Of the five schools that have a 100% passing algebra rate, three of them are schools from the Far North Side.</li>

         <ul>
            <li>1) The Far North Side and the Central regions of Chicago have the lowest rates of people without high schools diplomas.  </li>
            <li>2) South Lawndale and Gage Park are the only two communities where over fifty percent of their population has no high school diploma.  However, compared to some of the  other communities on the tree map, Gage Park and South Lawndale have average rates of poverty.  </li>
            <li>3) Riverdale and Fuller Park, two communities in the South Side of Chicago, have over fifty percent of their populations that live below the poverty line, but their rates of people who have no high school diploma hover around thirty percent.</li>

         <ul>
            <li>1) The Central region and the Far Noth Side of Chicago have the two lowest median rates of individuals without high school diplomas which corroborates the tree map above.</li>
            <li>2) The Southwest Side has the largest spread of rates of individuals with no high school diplomas with the distance between the minimum and maximum being almost 50 percentage points.</li>
            <li>3) The central region has the smallest spread of rates of individuals with no high school diplomas at 7.8 percentage points, which makes sense given that thereare only four neighborhoods contained within the Central region.</li>
